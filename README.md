## Abstract 

In decisions from experience, systematic choices between prospects are based on the assessment of differences in latent properties. Yet, several properties can be used to distinguish among the prospects. To this end, this paper presents a sampling and accumulation model that allows sampling  strategies—i.e., the probability of sampling outcomes from different prospects in direct succession (switching probability)—to alter which differences in the latent properties evidence is accumulated for. Specifically, the proposed model sequentially samples outcomes from two prospects and accumulates the results obtained from a sequence of ordinal comparisons between sample means, with switching probabilities determining the size of the samples underlying each comparison and thresholds determining how many comparisons a prospect must win in order to be chosen. A computational implementation of the model is used to simulate the respective information-processing chains upfront choices between a safe and a two-outcome prospect, while varying switching probabilities and thresholds. The analysis of the simulation data shows that, depending on whether the accumulation process unfolds over mean comparisons based on small or large samples, evidence is accumulated for differences either in the probability to produce a higher outcome most of the time or in the expected value. The respective choice patterns reflect an as-if underweighting of rare outcomes or expected value maximization, both of which become more robust with increasing thresholds. The analysis moreover shows how the distinct choice patterns resulting from differences in the information-processing chains translate to the parameters of cumulative prospect theory’s value and weighting function.
