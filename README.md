This is a repository for a work in progress paper that is currently being prepared for submission as a master's thesis.

## Description 

The paper approaches decision making as an information processing problem whose solution requires a selection among choice alternatives.
Often, however, the properties by which the choice alternatives can be distinguished, are not readily described; rather, proper descriptions must be inferred from whatever information the
inputs (i.e. samples) provide about the properties of alternatives, using transformation rules,
statistical generalizations, or both. 
This paper argues that selection criteria are central to the decision making process, since they impose constraints on the assessment of choice alternatives, leading to characteristic choice
patterns that are eventually blurred by inaccurate property descriptions. 
The rationale behind sampling strategies is discussed and computational models are used to simulate their effect on the property inferences and the resulting choice patterns.
