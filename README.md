## Abstract 

In decisions from experience, the probability to produce a higher outcome most of the time and the expected value are two latent properties that can be used to distinguish among the prospects of choice. This paper sketches a sampling and accumulation model that allows sampling strategies—i.e., the probability of sampling outcomes from different prospects in direct succession (switching probability)—to alter the degree to which evidence is accumulated for either one of these properties. A computational implementation of the model is used to simulate the respective sampling and accumulation process upfront choices between a safe and a two-outcome prospect, while varying switching probabilities and evidence thresholds. The simulation data shows that, depending on which latent property evidence is accumulated for and to which extent, respectively, choice patterns reflect various degrees of an as-if underweighting of rare outcomes or expected value maximization. Both choice patterns become more robust the more evidence is sampled and translate to characteristic parameter estimates for cumulative prospect theory’s value and weighting function.
