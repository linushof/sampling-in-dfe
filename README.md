# Sampling in Decisions from Experiences 

## Abstract 

A probability theoretic definition of prospects and a rough stochastic sampling model for decisions from experience is proposed.
It is demonstrated how the model can be used a) to explicate assumptions about the sampling and decision strategies that agents may apply and b) to derive predictions about function forms and parameter values that describe the resulting decision behavior. 
Synthetic choice data is simulated and modeled in cumulative prospect theory to test these predictions.
